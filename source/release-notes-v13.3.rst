library functions that allow client programs to pass queries to the PostgreSQL
backend server and to receive the results of these queries." [#]_

This release of |pdp| is based on `PostgreSQL 13.3 <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/13.3/>`_.


.. [#] Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via |SLA|. They are included in this release so that users can provide feedback prior to the full release of the feature in a future |GA| release (or removal of the feature if it is deemed not useful). This functionality can change (APIs, CLIs, etc.) from tech preview to GA.
